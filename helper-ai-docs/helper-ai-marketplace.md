This document equips the Helper AI with full knowledge of how the Control Room Marketplace works so it can accurately assist users with listing, buying, managing, and optimizing AI agents.

## 🛒 Marketplace Overview

- The Control Room Marketplace allows users to **buy, sell, and manage AI agents** built for various tasks.
- Users can monetize agents they’ve built, or find plug-and-play agents made by others.
- Available to all signed-in users, accessible via the top nav: `/marketplace`.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Listing an Agent

- **Anyone can submit an agent** to the marketplace.
- However, **all submissions are reviewed manually** for:
  - Security
  - Performance
  - Compliance with TOS
- Approval is required before any listing becomes visible or purchasable.

### Required Listing Details:
- Agent Name
- Description
- Pricing Type (Fixed or Recurring)
- Price
- Category (e.g., Automation, Research, Data Extraction)
- Feature Tags
- GitHub (or hosted) repo link (optional)
- Documentation (if available)
- Thumbnail image

## 💸 Pricing Structure

- Sellers may choose:
  - **Fixed Price** (one-time purchase)
  - **Recurring Monthly Price** (subscription model)
- Control Room takes a **20% platform fee** from every sale.
- Example:
  - Agent listed at $50 → Seller receives $40.

---

## 💰 Payments & Payouts

- **All transactions are processed through Stripe.**
- Sellers must connect a Stripe account to receive payouts.
- Payouts are disbursed according to Stripe’s cycle.
- Platform automatically deducts the 20% cut before seller receives funds.

---

## ✅ Approval Flow

1. User submits agent
2. Admin receives and reviews submission
3. If approved:
   - Agent is published in the Marketplace
   - Users can buy or subscribe
4. If denied:
   - User receives rejection notice with feedback (if available)

Helper AI Response Examples:
- “Your agent has been submitted and is awaiting manual review. You'll be notified once it's approved or rejected.”
- “Make sure your agent has clear documentation and a working test before submission to improve approval chances.”

## 🔎 For Buyers

- Buyers can browse, filter, and purchase agents directly through the Marketplace.
- Upon purchase:
  - The agent is automatically added to the user’s workspace.
  - They can begin using, customizing, or integrating it immediately.

## 🧠 AI Behavior Guidelines

- Never approve or reject agents — Helper AI is purely supportive.
- Always remind the user that listings are **manually reviewed for quality and security.**
- Always reference the 20% fee, Stripe connection, and approval step when discussing payouts or revenue.
- If the user asks about terms or legal issues:
  > “Marketplace terms are covered in our Terms of Service. You can find them linked in the footer of our homepage.”

---

## 🔐 RBAC

- **Admin, Manager, and Viewer roles** all have visibility into the Marketplace.
- Only Admins and Managers can submit or manage listings.

If a Viewer asks to submit:
> “You’ll need Manager or Admin access in your workspace to list agents. I recommend sharing this with your team lead.”
