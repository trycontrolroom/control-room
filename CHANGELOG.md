# Control Room v5 - Workspace Lifecycle & Role-Based Access Control Hot-Fix

## Overview
This release implements comprehensive workspace lifecycle management and per-workspace role-based access control (RBAC) to fix workspace creation, switching, and role enforcement issues in Control Room v4.

## 🔧 Major Features & Fixes

### 1. Workspace Lifecycle Management
- **Fixed workspace creation flow**: Users can now create workspaces directly from the Settings page with automatic ADMIN role assignment
- **Implemented workspace switching**: Navigation dropdown allows seamless switching between workspaces with persistence via cookies
- **Added workspace persistence**: Active workspace is maintained across sessions using HTTP cookies
- **Enhanced workspace API**: Updated `/api/workspaces` to return current workspace and user roles

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Per-workspace role enforcement**: Implemented workspace-scoped permissions for ADMIN, MANAGER, and VIEWER roles
- **Updated middleware**: Added comprehensive workspace role checking in `middleware.ts`
- **API route protection**: All workspace-related endpoints now enforce proper role-based permissions
- **Admin panel updates**: Moved role management to workspace-scoped Admin → Workspace Users tab

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- **Added missing foreign keys**: Updated `UserPreferences` model to include `workspaceId` for proper workspace scoping
- **Enhanced seed data**: Added multi-workspace test data with "Aegis HQ" and "Beta Ops" workspaces

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Application Files
- **`middleware.ts`**: Added workspace-scoped role enforcement and permission checking
- **`lib/auth.ts`**: Enhanced authentication helpers for workspace role validation

  - Updated GET method to return current workspace and user roles
  - Added POST method for workspace creation with automatic ADMIN assignment
- **`app/api/workspaces/switch/route.ts`**: Enhanced workspace switching with proper cookie management
- **`app/api/workspaces/members/[id]/route.ts`**: NEW - PATCH endpoint for updating workspace member roles
- **`app/api/agents/route.ts`**: Updated to use workspace-scoped role checking instead of global roles
- **`app/api/policies/route.ts`**: Updated to use workspace-scoped role checking instead of global roles  
- **`app/api/custom-metrics/route.ts`**: Updated to use workspace-scoped role checking instead of global roles

### Admin Panel

  - Completely refactored to show workspace-scoped user management
  - Added tabbed interface for "Workspace Users" and "Settings"
  - Implemented inline role editing with protection against demoting last ADMIN
  - Added user status display (ACTIVE/INVITED) and last login information

### Database & Configuration
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: Added `workspaceId` foreign key to `UserPreferences` model

- **`.env.local`**: Added complete environment configuration for local development

## 🔒 Role Enforcement Matrix

| Route / Component | ADMIN | MANAGER | VIEWER |
|-------------------|-------|---------|--------|
| POST /api/users/invite | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| POST /api/agents/* (create/pause/delete) | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| POST /api/policies/* | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| GET dashboards & analytics | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Marketplace → List Agent | ✔️¹ | ✔️¹ | ❌ |
| Admin Panel | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ |

¹ Only if the user also has the global SELLER flag (unchanged)

## 🧪 Test Data
The seed script now creates:
- **Workspace "Aegis HQ"** with admin@control-room.ai as ADMIN
- **Workspace "Beta Ops"** with admin@control-room.ai as VIEWER and manager@control-room.ai as MANAGER
- Test users: admin@control-room.ai (password: admin123) and manager@control-room.ai (password: manager123)

## 🚀 Deployment Notes
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply database schema changes
- Run `npx prisma db seed` to populate test workspaces and users
- Ensure all environment variables are properly configured in production

## ✅ Verification Checklist
- [x] Workspace creation flow works seamlessly with immediate switching
- [x] Role enforcement is consistent across all API endpoints
- [x] Admin panel shows workspace-scoped user management
- [x] Workspace switching persists across sessions
- [x] Cannot demote last remaining ADMIN in workspace
- [x] All existing functionality preserved (marketplace, policies, custom metrics)

## 🔄 Migration Required
This release requires a database migration to add the `workspaceId` foreign key to the `UserPreferences` table. Run the following commands after deployment:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-workspace-id-to-user-preferences
npx prisma db seed
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed workspace creation redirecting to settings without actually creating workspace
- Fixed role enforcement using global roles instead of workspace-scoped roles
- Fixed admin panel showing global users instead of workspace members
- Fixed missing workspace persistence across browser sessions
- Fixed ability to demote last ADMIN from workspace

**Control Room v5** is now ready for production with complete workspace lifecycle management and robust role-based access control.
